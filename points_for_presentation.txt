    - Automatic database migration.
    - Dockerized using docker compose to pull the database image, no need for any setup.
    - Optimized the dockerization by bringing it down in size. From more than 1GB to around 40MB using multi stage builds, Alpine linux image and only using necessary files.
    - Secured using authentication tokens.  
    - Cookie support and automatic cookie setting.
    - Extremely fast and multithreated thanks to go's http library.

Frontend:
    - Android app using MVVM architecture.
    - Room database for persistency even without data from the web service.
    - Used BottomNavBar for navigation.
    - Cookie handling with OkHttp's cookie jar.
    - Apart from that, fairly simple android app, since it wasn't the focus of the application.
